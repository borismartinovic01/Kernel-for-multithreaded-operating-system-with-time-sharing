# Kernel-for-multithreaded-operating-system-with-time-sharing

## Important
Full source code available in private repository. If you want to view it follow me and I will add you.

### General Info
***
Kernel implementation for multithreaded operating system. Configuration is similar to embedded systems configuration where kernel and user application share the same address space and represent one program which is in advance loaded in working memory. Kernel is implemented for RISC V architecture.

### Implemented concepts
***
A list of concepts implemented within the project:
* Memory allocator
* Threads
* Semaphores
* Time sharing
* Preemption on interrupt from timer and keyboard
* Synchronized and asynchronized context switch
* I/O operations
* Kernel interfaces (ABI, C API, C++ API)
